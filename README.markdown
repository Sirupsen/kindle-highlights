kindle-highlights
============

*Get your Kindle highlights via Amazon's Kindle site*

There's currently no Kindle API, so I built a scraper.

**Required gems**

* ruby-aaws
* Mechanize

The ruby-aaws gem assumes you have an Associates tracking code, and Product API credentials.  A handy guide for setting up the ruby-aaws gem can be found at [http://snippets.aktagon.com/snippets/413-How-to-access-Amazon-product-data-with-Ruby-AWS-and-the-Amazon-Associates-Web-Services-API](http://snippets.aktagon.com/snippets/413-How-to-access-Amazon-product-data-with-Ruby-AWS-and-the-Amazon-Associates-Web-Services-API).  The kindle-highlights gem depends on the ruby-aaws gem to grab data about the product from which the highlight came, and will not work without ruby-aaws being set up properly.

**Install**
	
	gem install kindle-highlights
**Use**
	require 'kindle-highlights'

	# to create a new KindleHighlights object, give it your Amazon email address and password	
	kindle = KindleHighlights.new("foo@bar.com", "password")
	
	kindle.highlights.each do |highlight|
		highlight.annotation_id # => a unique value for each highlight, generated by Amazon
		highlight.content # => the actual highlight text
		highlight.asin # => the Amazon ASIN for the highlight's product
		highlight.author # => author of the book from which the highlight is taken
		highlight.title # => title of the book from which the highlight is taken
	end

**Updates**

* Added annotation_id to Highlight class (2011.12.20)

**TODO**

* Add dependencies to Mechanize and ruby-aaws within gemspec
* Exception handling
* Cache AWS Product API results to save time
* Get all highlights; Amazon currently does an infinite-scroll at the page bottom which loads highlights dynamically.  Currently the gem only gets the first "page" of highlights.

* Tests
